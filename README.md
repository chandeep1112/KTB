[Live Application](https://kitabe.up.railway.app/) 🌐

### Objective ✍
Our objective is to build an application for all Book Lovers ♥ like us out there where all you have to
do is rate some of your favorite books and the application will do it's **voodoo magic** 🧙‍♂️ and give you some more books that you may **love😍 to read**.

### Dataset 🧾
The Dataset that we used for this task is the [goodbooks-10k](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) dataset. It consists of 10k books with a total of 6 million ratings. That's huge right! 😮. There are some more huge datasets such as [Book-Crossings](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) but they are kinda old 😬.
